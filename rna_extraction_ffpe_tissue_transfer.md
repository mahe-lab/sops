- QIAGEN RNEasy FFPE Handbook: 

### emergency
- Use spill kit to clean up small spills; Contact maintenance and log incident for large spills
- If skin/eye contact with chemicals, flush aggressively and continuously with water using an eyewash, sink or shower
- Contact emergency services and log any injuries

### cleanup
- Benchtop/fumehood surface wipedown with 70% isopropanol

### waste
- Tips/Tubes should be disposed of in yellow biohazard bag
- Xylene/ethanol should be disposed of in chemical waste container (fumehood)
- QIAGEN reagent/flow through should be disposed of in aqueous chemical waste
- Sharps disposal: use approved biohazard bucket

### maintenance
- Wipe surfaces down with 70% isopropanol
- Do not use isopropanol on instruments

### before_starting
- Ensure that sufficient Xylene, 100% Ethanol, buffer PKD, Proteinase K, DNase I, DNase booster, buffer RBC, buffer RPE and RNase-free (DEPC) water available
-
- DNase I stock solution (from QIAGEN DNase I kit): Dissolve lyophilized DNase I (1500 Kunitz units) in 550 μl RNase-free water
- DNase 1 stock solution can be kept for 9+ months at -20C 
-
- Obtain fresh scrape blades (one per specimen)
- Extra 2 mL microfuge tubes, RNeasy columns and elution (specimen collection) tubes are required

### procedures
1. Ensure that specimens are accessioned and that a sufficient number of labels are printed (usually 3 per specimen)
2. IF STARTING WITH CURLS/SCROLLS OR TISSUE TRANSFER MATERIAL: Ensure the tube(s) are correctly labelled; move to step 4
3. IF STARTING WITH SLIDES: If coverslipped, soak with xylene in a Coplin jar in fume hood for ~4 hours; use gentle traction (applied using forceps or another slide) to remove the coverslip; Use a fresh scrape blade to scrape off the materials into a labelled 2.0 mL microfuge tube
4. In the fumehood, add 1 ml xylene per tube
5. Cap, vortex well and incubate 5 min at RT
6. Centrifuge 2 min at 16,000 × g at RT and carefully pipette off the supernatant
7. Add 1mL >95% Ethanol
8. Vortex 10 s and incubate 5 min at RT
9. Centrifuge 3 min at 16,000 × g at RT and pipette off the supernatant
10. Let the tube stand open in the hood to dry the pellet
11.	Add 240 μl Buffer PKD, and mix by vortexing
12.	Add 10 μl Proteinase K. Mix gently by pipetting up and down.
13.	Incubate at 56°C for 15 min at 500 rpm in the thermomixer 
14.	Incubate at 80 °C for 15 min at 500 rpm in the thermomixer 
15.	Incubate on ice for 3 min
16.	Centrifuge for 15 min at 16,000 × g
17.	Transfer supernatant to a new labelled microfuge tube
18.	Add 25 uL DNase booster buffer & 10 uL DNase 1 stock solution
19.	Mix gently by inversion & incubate at RT for 15 minutes
20.	Add 500 uL buffer RBC and vortex
21.	Add 1000 uL 100% Ethanol & mix well by pipetting up and down. CAREFUL, TUBE WILL BE QUITE FULL!!
22.	Prepare an appropriately labelled RNeasy Column (these will come packaged with a 2 mL waste collection tube)
23.	Transfer 500 uL of the specimen from step 21 to the column
24.	Centrifuge 15 sec at 10,000 × g
25.	Discard flow-through in liquid waste
26.	Repeat steps 23-25 until all the materials from step 21 are passed through the column
27.	Add 500 μl Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column
28.	Centrifuge for 15 s at 10,000 × g
29.	Discard flow-through
30.	Repeat steps 27-29 then transfer the column to a new labelle specimen (elution) tube
31.	Carefully add 30 uL RNase-free water to the CENTER of the column. Avoid touching the walls/sides of the column with pipette tip
32.	Centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute the RNA
33.	Proceed to RNA quantification
34.	Store specimen in -20C freezer (allocate the storage location in the specimen database)
