- SYPRO can be re-used 4 times prior to disposal (store in a light-safe/brown jar)

### maintenance
- Rinse blotting equipment with ddH2O after use
- Wipedown ChemiDoc tray(s) with moistened kim wipes after use

### before_starting

- 

### procedures
1. Immerse the blot(s) completely in blot wash buffer
2. Incubate at room temperate for 15 minutes with gentle shaking
3. Incubate the membrane in four changes of ddH2O for 5 minutes each
4. Completely immerse the membrane in SYPRO Ruby blot stain reagent (10-20 mL per blot) for 15 minutes
5. Wash the membrane 4â€“6 times for 1 minute each in ddH2O to remove excess dye from the membrane
6. Image using ChemiDoc (Use the SYPRO Blot setting; Excitation at 280 or 450 nm and Emission at 618 nm)
7. IF INDICATED, PROCEED TO IMMUNODETECTION SOP
8. OTHERWISE: the membrane can be air-dried
