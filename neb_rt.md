### emergency
- If skin/eye contact with chemicals, flush aggressively and continuously with water using an eyewash, sink or shower
- Contact emergency services and log any injuries if required

### cleanup
- Wipe down work surfaces with 70% isopropanol
- 5 minute Dead-air UV exposure

### waste
- Tips/Tubes should be disposed of in biohazard bags

### maintenance

### before_starting
- Obtain some ice and place in the dead-air box ice box; the aluminum tube tray can be chilled in the dead-air box ice box
- Obtain sufficient tubes/strips to accomodate the specimens; label the tubes/strips appropriately
- Run 5 minute Dead-air UV exposure
- AFTER UV pre-treatment, identify the specimens for RT (scan/enter the specimen accession numbers below), as well as the necessary NEB reagents. Gently warm these on ice until ready to make the RT working solution.

### procedures
1. Using the above calculator, prepare the RT working solution (WS). Return NEB reagents to the freezer.
2. Pipette out the required water for each reaction per the above calculator
3. Pipette 5.75 uL of RTWS into each tube
4. Pipette out the required specimen volumes into each respective tube; gently pipette up and down to ensure that the solutions are well mixed, ensuring not to cross-contaminate
5. Keep the specimens on ice until ready to proceed to the thermocycler
6. Run the NEB WarmStart RTx program: 5 minutes at 25째C for annealing; 10 minutes at 55째C for synthesis; 10 minutes at 80째C for heat inactivation
7. Store cDNA products in -20째C freezer until ready for downstream use
