- BioRad Protein Blotting Guide: 

### emergency
- If skin/eye contact with chemicals, flush aggressively and continuously with water using an eyewash, sink or shower
- Contact emergency services and log any injuries if required

### cleanup
- Wipe down work surfaces with 70% isopropanol
- NOTE: Do not use isopropanol on instruments

### waste
- Tips/Tubes should be disposed of in yellow biohazard bag/tub
- Dispose of contaminated gels in contaminated gel waste bucket

### maintenance
- Rinse blotting equipment with ddH2O after use

### before_starting
- Ensure that sufficient transfer buffer is available:
- Mix 200 mL Methanol and 100 mL 10x Running Buffer (from SDS-PAGE SOP); add ddH2O up to 1L
- 
- Gather the necessary blotting equipment:
- 1 Western Blot cassette
- 2 x plastic (black) fibre pads, soaked in a dish of transfer buffer
- 2 x filter paper, cut to the correct size (relative to the gel) and soaked in transfer buffer
- 1 x Nitrocellulose blot membrane per gel

### procedures
1. Place the WB cassette gray side down and open the cassette (the black side should now be perpendicular to the bottom gray side)
2. Place the first plastic fibre pad on the inner flat surface
3. Place the first filter paper on top of the plastic fibre pad
4. Gently place the gel onto of the filter paper with notch to the outside left of the cassette
5. Use a roller to gently push out any bubbles between the gel and the filter paper
6. Apply the nitrocellulose blot sheet oriented so that the notches correspond
7. Use the roller to gently push out any bubbles between the membrane and the gel
8. Apply the second filter paper
9. Use the roller to gently push out any bubbles between the filter paper and the membrane
10. Apply the second plastic fibre pad
11. Carefully close the cassette and clamp the white latch
12. Repeat steps 1-11 for the other gel. MAKE A DOUBLE NOTCH AT THE TOP LEFT TO DISTINGUISH THE SECOND GEL/BLOT COMBINATION FROM THE FIRST
13. Place the cooling pack, the electrophoresis module and a stir bar into a Bio-Rad electrophoresis tank; place the tank on a magnetic stir plate (NO HEAT)
14. Insert the cassettes into the module and turn on stirring to the highest setting possible; donâ€™t let the stir bar knock against the module components
15. Assemble the lid and attach the cables
16. SET RUN PARAMETERS: constant 350 mA x 1 hour
17. PROCEED EITHER TO TOTAL PROTEIN SOP OR IMMUNODETECTION SOP (IF DOING BOTH, PROCEED TO TOTAL PROTEIN SOP FIRST)
