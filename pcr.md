### emergency
- If skin/eye contact with chemicals, flush aggressively and continuously with water using an eyewash, sink or shower
- Contact emergency services and log any injuries if required

### cleanup
- Wipe down work surfaces with 70% isopropanol
- 5 minute Dead-air UV exposure

### waste
- Tips/Tubes should be disposed of in biohazard bag/tub

### maintenance
- Wipe down work surfaces with 70% isopropanol
- 5 minute Dead-air UV exposure

### before_starting
- This protocol assumes that each PCR reaction is meant to employ the same pair (or multiplex pair) of primers; if different combinations of primer pairs (or multiplex primer pairs) are planned, apply this protocol in parallel for each primer pair (or multiplex pair) of primers

### procedures
1. Obtain some ice and place in the dead-air box ice box; the aluminum tube tray can be chilled in the dead-air box ice box
2. Identify the specimens for PCR (as listed in the tool above), remove from freezer and place them in the dead-air box ice box
3. Remove the ROCHE PCR Master (Vial #1) and Primers from the freezer and thaw slowly on ice in the dead-air box
4. Prepare a primer working solution (PWS) for each primer pair combination:

____ (# specimens) x 27 = ____ uL ROCHE PCR MASTER Mix
____ (# specimens) x 0.55 = ____ uL Primer 1
____ (# specimens) x 0.55 = ____ uL Primer 2

5.	Return the ROCHE PCR MASTER Mix to the -20°C freezer

6.	Identify the volumes of each DNA specimen required for reaction input:
•	The input DNA mass should be 500-1000 ng and should be uniform between reactions
•	No more than 25 uL of input DNA specimen can be added to a given reaction
•	Calculate the balance of water required for each reaction 
(ie DNA volume + water volume = 25 uL)

7.	Pipette out the required water for each reaction

8.	Pipette 25 uL of PWS into each tube

9.	Pipette in the DNA inputs carefully (last); mix well by pipetting up/down several times; try to prevent drips from collecting on the side of the tubes

10.	Keep the specimens on ice until ready to proceed to the thermocycler

11.	Run the ROCHE MASTER MIX STANDARD PCR program:
i.	Initial denaturation: 2 minutes at 94°C
ii.	30 cycles of:
i.	Denaturation: 30 seconds at 94°C
ii.	Annealing: 60 seconds at 50°C (or set alternative based on lowest primer Tm)
iii.	Elongation: 60 seconds at 72°C
iii.	Final elongation: 7 minutes at 72°C

12.	Proceed directly to gel electrophoresis or other downstream analysis OR store specimens in -20°C freezer
