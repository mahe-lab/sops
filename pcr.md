### before_starting
- This protocol assumes that each PCR reaction is meant to employ the same pair (or multiplex pair) of primers; if different combinations of primer pairs (or multiplex primer pairs) are planned, apply this protocol in parallel for each primer pair (or multiplex pair) of primers
-  
- Obtain some ice and place in the dead-air box ice box; the aluminum tube tray can be chilled in the dead-air box ice box
- Obtain sufficient tubes/strips/plates to accomodate the specimens & label appropriately
- Remove specimens, ROCHE PCR Master (Vial #1) and Primers from the freezer and thaw slowly on ice in the dead-air box
- Use the calculator below to plan the PCR layout
